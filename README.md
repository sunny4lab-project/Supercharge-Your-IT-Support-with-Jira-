## 🚀 Supercharge Your IT Support with Jira!

A ticketing system is a tool used by IT support teams to manage and track requests from end-users. When an issue arises, a user submits a request (a “ticket”), and the IT team addresses the issue by following the workflow in the system.

### 🚀 Ticket Lifecycle:
1. **New Ticket Created** – A user submits an issue.
2. **Ticket Assigned** – A support specialist jumps on it.
3. **Troubleshooting in Action** – The specialist investigates and works on a fix.
4. **Resolution & Closure**:
   - The issue is fixed, and the user is notified.
   - Ticket is marked as **Resolved** or **Closed**.
5. **Post-Incident Review**:
   - Review tricky cases to improve future support strategies.
